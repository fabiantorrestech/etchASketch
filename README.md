This is a beginner level Javascript project for me. My main objective with this project was to only use Javascript for most of the code to meet the criteria of the etch-a-sketch project from TOP. I did also touch CSS for easier styling, but most of the functional code for JS and what could be done in HTML was done all in Javascript.
